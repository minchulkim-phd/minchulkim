		<p><center>ABSTRACT</center></p>
		<p> Personalization refers to the journalistic practice of including emotional case studies of ordinary people in news stories, increasing vividness and emotional charge of news and eliciting identification and empathy in news consumers. Previous research suggests that personalization of news stories increases collectivistic (compared with individualistic) causal attributions by the news audience. In response, an experiment was conducted with a week time delay between stimuli presentation and open-ended participant responses to examine the influence of news personalization on how news consumers attribute causes for social issues. Participant (N = 80) trait empathy was included as an additional factor. Findings show that participants with high trait empathy expressed a greater shift to collectivistic attribution after watching personalized news stories than participants with low trait empathy, suggesting that individual differences in trait empathy may be an important factor in how individuals construct their own under- standing of social problems.</p>

Testing Partisan Selective Exposure in a Multidimensional Choice Context: Evidence from a Conjoint Experiment. <i>Mass Communication and Society</i>, <i>23</i>, 107-127. doi:10.1080/15205436.2019.1636283 <a href='http://dx.doi.org//10.1080/15205436.2019.1636283'>[pdf]</a></p>
		<p><center>ABSTRACT</center></p>
		<p> The methodological shortcomings characterizing previous experimental research on selective and cross-cutting exposure (e.g. focusing on the impact of a few experimental factors and providing a limited range of choice alternatives) amount to an incomplete description of news choice behavior. This study proposes an alternative method that addresses these shortcomings in testing partisan news selection in the current media environment. A conjoint experiment (N = 746), which simulates a popular mobile news platform (iOS news app), showed that while partisans preferred selecting news from pro-attitudinal sources, they also selected news from counter-attitudinal sources at least once in five times (20%). The tendency to engage in selective exposure was slightly stronger among strong partisans. Our findings indicate that the concerns over partisan selective exposure may not be an issue of “selection” but more of “access” to news sources with different political views. The implications for future research are discussed. </p>

Parental Influence on Adolescent Preference for Television Public Affairs Content: A South Korean Panel Study. <i>Journalism and Mass Communication Quarterly</i>, <i>96</i>, 497-515. doi:10.1177/1077699018754910 <a href='http://dx.doi.org//10.1177/1077699018754910'>[pdf]</a></p>
		<p><center>ABSTRACT</center></p>
		<p> In this study, I examined parental influence on the development of preference for television public affairs content as a component of political socialization that empowers adolescents to acquire information about politics and civic affairs. A pooled sample (N = 795) constructed from multiple survey waves (2011-2014) from the annual Korean Media Panel Study was used for the data analysis. The findings showed that mothers—not fathers—had an influence on adolescent preference for public affairs content regardless of their children’s gender. The study thus unmasked a gendered mechanism of parental influence on adolescent television habits. </p>

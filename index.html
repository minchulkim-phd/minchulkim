	<h1>Hi there, I'm Minchul Kim!</h1>
	<p>My name is Minchul Kim and I have received a Ph.D. in Mass Communications in February 2020 from Indiana University. </p>
	<p>My research explores how digital news platforms and individual socio-psychological characteristics shape public engagement with political information. </p>
	<p>I am also interested in uncovering how message characteristics of news content and individual psychological characteristics jointly influence the political communication processes.</p>
	
	<p>I use a wide range of methodological approaches including but not limited to experiments, surveys, secondary data analysis, and computerized textual analysis.</p>
	<p>My research has appeared in Journalism and Mass Communication Quarterly, Mass Communication and Society, and International Journal of Communication.</p>
